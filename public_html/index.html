        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>My name is Austin Matias, and I have a love for learning, and growing
            myself through the opportunities provided to me. My number one 
            passion has to be computer hardware and software. I have been behind
            a computer for as long as I can remember, and I have loved it the whole time</p>
        <p>I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, currently
            studying to obtain a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. </p>
