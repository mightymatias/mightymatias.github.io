    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Austin Matias, and I am a 24 year old senior computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro!</p>

    <h3>Professions/Computer Science Skills</h3>
    <p>I am currently enlisted in the North Carolina Army National Guard, where I work as a Financial Management Technician. I have been a part of the National Guard since 2015. 
        <br>
        <br>
        While serving, I have deployed twice. Once to Qatar in 2017, and once to Kuwait in 2019. There, I audited pay accounts for soldiers throughout the middle-east, and provided tech support for the rest of my team. <br>
        <br>
        This tech support would involve everything from fixing a jammed printer, to coordinating with the military base's information technology specialists to get computers reimaged and have more complex issues worked out.
        <br><br>
        Outside of the military, I am very experienced with Java. I am working to expand my skillset (hence the website you are seeing now), and I have a passion to learn more. I tackle problems head on, and persue solutions relentlessly.
    </p>

    <h3>Hobbies/Recreation</h3>
    <p>Outside of academia and work, I am a avid player of most video games. For a sense of my type of games, my favorites currently are Final Fantasy XIV, Apex Legends, and Destiny 2.
        <br><br>
        I'm not all about computers though. When I step away from a screen, I really enjoy the outdoors! Over the summer of 2021, I went on a 2 day, 15.5 mile hike through the Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina. That was a wild and very fun experience. I hope to do more things like this in the future, and one of my goal hikes is to one day complete the Mountain-to-Sea trail in North Carolina.
