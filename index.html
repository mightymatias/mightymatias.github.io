			My name is Austin Matias, and I have a love for learning, and growing
            myself through the opportunities provided to me. My number one 
            passion has to be computer hardware and software. I have been behind.
            a computer for as long as I can remember, and I have loved it the whole time.
        </p>
        
        <p>I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, currently
            studying to obtain a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
